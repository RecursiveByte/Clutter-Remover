ðŸš€ Automation Magic: Node.js File Organizer Project ðŸ“‚

Just completed an exciting personal project that solves a common digital clutter problem! I've developed a Node.js script that automatically organizes messy folders by creating directories based on file extensions and moving files into their corresponding folders.

Project Highlights:
- Automatically detects different file types in a directory
- Creates folders dynamically for each unique file extension
- Moves files into their respective extension-named folders
- Simplifies file management with a single script execution

Tech Stack:
- Language: Node.js
- Key Modules: fs (File System), path

Why This Matters:
In today's digital world, file management can be a nightmare. This script is a simple yet powerful solution to keep your directories clean and organized with minimal effort. Perfect for developers, designers, and anyone struggling with file clutter!

ðŸ”§ Open to collaboration and feedback! Would love to hear your thoughts on file management automation.
