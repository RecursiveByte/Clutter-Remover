# Clutter Remover 📂

A simple Node.js tool that automatically organizes your messy directories by sorting files based on their extensions.

## How to Use 🚀

1. Copy all files from the `clutterRemover` directory in my GitHub repository

2. Place these files in the directory where you want to organize your files

3. Open terminal/command prompt in that directory and run:
```bash
node index.js
```

4. Done! 🎉 Check the `distortion` directory - you'll find all your files neatly organized into folders based on their extensions.

## Example
Your messy directory with mixed files will be organized like this:
```
distortion/
├── pdf/
│   └── (all PDF files)
├── jpg/
│   └── (all JPG files)
├── txt/
│   └── (all TXT files)
└── ... (other extension folders)
```

That's it! Simple and effective file organization with just one command. 🗂️
